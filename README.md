Please send email (through pebble store contact link) if you try it & have issues or suggestions.

Based nearly entirely on John Costik's SIMPLE CGM SPARK watchface - all kudos to him, all blame to me. This version has an analog clock, lower profile CGM displays, and adds battery level, tap or wrist flick to refresh CGM data, IOB display for Nightscout Careportal IOB-enabled sites (& COB for Nightscout 0.9.0-beta3+), color choice, and other options.

Simple CGM MUST NOT BE USED TO MAKE MEDICAL DECISIONS. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.   

The watchface requires: Active use of G5 Mobile app or the Share receiver with the Dexcom Share2 iOS application sending data to their cloud service. OR active use of recent Nightscout version.

Color choices are from: https://developer.pebble.com/guides/tools-and-resources/color-picker/ (E.g., enter "DarkGreen" for GColorDarkGreen).  B&W Pebbles should probably stick to just black or white colors, although lightgray or darkgray may have some effect.
